 Your job for this project is to create an application that will quantify and summarize data from the excel sheet titled 
`Super_Bowl_Projectl.csv`.  Construct an application that will read data from the `Super_Bowl_Project.csv` spreadsheet and 
assign each of the row item as an object within your program.  Once your program has created an instance for each row within 
the spreadsheet begin to manipulate the data according to the bullet points below.  Once you have constructed code for the 
following bullet points generate a text file that outputs the quantified and summarized data.

* The team name
* The Year the team won
* The winning quarterback

### For the below questions, output a single value:

* Which coach lost the most super bowls?
* Which coach won the most super bowls?
* Which team won the most super bowls?
* Which team lost the most super bowls?
* Which Super bowl had the greatest point difference?
* What has been the average attendance of all super bowls?


### Program Considerations

* Please include a title for each output to the text file along with proper spacing

* Allow the end-user to select the desired file path where text file will output (the program must not fail if path does not exist)

* Your program should read the file from where the project folder exist.
