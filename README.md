# SuperBowlStats.cs
Advanced programming project 2
Hey Brent! 
I believe if you download the Super_Bowl_Project folder as a hole, everything should run in VS.

The assignment requirements are commented at the top of the program file
//The .csv file is also included within the Super_Bowl_Project folder


Thanks for playing around with this! I'm very curious to see how they compare!
